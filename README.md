# 'At the zenith of the Information Age, a writer, designer, and lover of languages appears.' 

*Salvete*, *khairete*, and *shalom*, my friends! I'm 𐤕𐤌 𐤃𐤉 𐤌𐤍, or Tom di Mino, or that most curious of 'Content Designers' with an 🧿 for poetry, mysticism, and the emerging discipline of ["affective computing."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09582) 

If you're here, it's safe to say you're a bit of a digger (like myself), inclined to poke around and exhume a subject until you've reached the root and tasted the truth of it. 

# I believe in you already.

Please visit [my business portfolio](https://www.minoanmystery.org) to see how I envisioned 'content strategy' for venerable brands, enterprise-grade websites, and open-source tech that benefits humanity as a whole. As your friendly, modern-day Minoan, I wield the eyes of antiquity and posterity to get at the heart of what you do, and make it clearer to the world.
