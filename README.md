# 'At the zenith of the Information Age, a writer, philosopher, and lover of languages appears.' 

*Salvete*, *khairete*, and *shalom*, my friends! I'm Tauma de Minu, or Tom di Mino, or simply that most curious of 'content designers' with a penchant for poetry, mysticism, and the emerging discipline of ["affective computing."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09582) 

If you're here, it's safe to say you're a bit of a digger (like myself), inclined to poke around and exhume a subject until you've reached the root and tasted the truth of it. 

# I believe in you already.

Peruse [my agency portfolio](https://www.minoanmystery.org) to see how I've applied 'content strategy' for startups, enterprise-grade websites, and open-source tech that benefit humanity as a whole. As your friendly, modern-day Minoan, I wield the lens of antiquity and posterity to get to the heart of what you do, and make it clearer in the world.
